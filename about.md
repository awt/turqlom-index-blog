#### Getting Started

1.  [Install Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page).
2.  Send a message via Bitmessage to:

    BM-2cTUZmrFaypXnAR4DAXLbAb6KrFPRhGyEe
    
    with the subject of the message as the title.  Your post will appear at:
    
    http://www.darklogs.com/\[your bitmessage address\]


#### Maintaining Your Anonymity

1.  Don't post information that can be used to identify you.  Examples include:
    * An email address
    * A link to a dropbox account
    * A facebook account
    * A twitter handle
    * A bitcoin address generated by a hosted wallet service

2.  Known Vulnerabilities of this Service

    * An entity with access to an internet backbone connection may be able to ascertain your general location.
    * An entity with access to network traffic originating from both the sending and receiving bitmessage clients
      may be able to precisely identify you.
      
    If you are concerned about your identity being revealed to an entity with these capabilities, you may want to consider using Bitmessage in conjunction with [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).
    
    For more details on these potential vulnerabilities, read the [Bitmessage Technical Paper](https://bitmessage.org/Bitmessage%20Technical%20Paper.pdf).
